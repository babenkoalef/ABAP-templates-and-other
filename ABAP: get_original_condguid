  METHOD get_original_condguid.

" Algorithm for getting the original condguid for real estate cashflow
" Standard SAP ERP RE-FX implementation uses a subsequence of conditions (Table VICDCOND) and treats them as linked
" For cashflow (which has a link to a condition (via CONDGUID)) - standard SAP uses the first GUID of a condition from the subsequence (An Original guid)

" IMPORTED PARAMETERS
" io_contract TYPE REF TO if_recn_contract  -> instance of the real estate contract 
" iv_guid     TYPE        recdcondguid      -> guid of the condition 
" RETURNING VALUES
" rv_guid     TYPE        recdcondguid      -> original condguid (first in the subsequence)
